# ðŸš¦ Traffic Condition Predictor

This project is a **Traffic Condition Prediction Application** built using **Streamlit**. It leverages machine learning to predict traffic conditions based on various input parameters such as vehicle count, traffic speed, road occupancy, traffic light state, and weather conditions.

## Features

- **Prediction**: Input traffic-related parameters and get predictions for traffic conditions.
- **Prediction History**: View a history of past predictions with visualizations.
- **Model Details**: Analyze the model's performance using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.
- **About Section**: Learn more about the application and its features.

## How It Works

1. **Input Parameters**:

   - Vehicle Count
   - Traffic Speed (km/h)
   - Road Occupancy (%)
   - Traffic Light State
   - Weather Condition
   - Accident Reported (Yes/No)
   - Hour of Day
   - Day of Week

2. **Prediction**:

   - The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model (`traffic_model.pkl`) to predict traffic conditions.
   - The model outputs the predicted traffic condition along with probabilities for each possible condition.

3. **History Tracking**:

   - All predictions are stored in a session-based history, allowing users to track and visualize past predictions.

4. **Visualization**:

   - The app uses **Plotly** to create interactive bar charts and histograms for prediction probabilities and history.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Users can view the confusion matrix and classification report to understand the model's performance.

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Dependencies

The application requires the following Python libraries:

- `streamlit`: For building the interactive web app.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning model loading and preprocessing.
- `joblib`: For loading serialized models and encoders.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For additional visualizations (if needed).
- `plotly`: For interactive charts and graphs.

## Usage

1. Launch the app using the `streamlit run app.py` command.
2. Navigate to the **Prediction** tab to input traffic parameters and get predictions.
3. View past predictions in the **Prediction History** tab.
4. Analyze the model's performance in the **Model Details** tab.
5. Learn more about the app in the **About** tab.

## Model Details

- The machine learning model (`traffic_model.pkl`) is trained on traffic-related data.
- Categorical features like `Traffic Light State`, `Weather Condition`, and `Day of Week` are encoded using label encoders (`label_encoders.pkl`).
- The model predicts traffic conditions and provides confidence scores for each possible condition.
